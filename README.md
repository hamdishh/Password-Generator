# Password Generator

## Description

This Weeks challenge was to produce a functional random password generator with the use of the provided arrays containing special characters, numeric values and upper and lower case letters options for the user to choose from that will be rendered within the password generator. The user is met with a prompt first asking to clarify their desired passworth length then is asked whether they would like to include special characters, numeric characters, and upper and lowercase letters. The password is then rendered depending on the users preferences.

## Code Highlights
On line 93 of my script.js file i used the parseInt(...) function that i found on w3schools. I found it extremely useful in my code as i needed it in order to be able to convert the users input from a string, which is what the 'prompt()' usually returns, to an integer.
